# Sample Configs: Shell processes

This directory contains sample config files for a Node Manager that manages a Ethereum Client and Privacy Manager running as shell processes.

* [nodemanager-config.sample.json](nodemanager-config.sample.json): Node Manager config file
* [peers.sample.json](peers.sample.json): Peers config file
* [scripts](scripts): Sample start and stop scripts for Node Manager to use to hibernate/wake up the Ethereum Client and Privacy Manager. (*These are simple examples.  In practice the scripts can be as simple or as complex as required.*)
